# Moy-Bag

This idea was deprecated in favor of using something else. It was fun while it lasted, and lots of things were learned. But trying to build a Server API in a Serverless environment like Firebase probably was not the most efficient or smart idea.

Anyways, I'd like to redo this project from zero but with a different approach.
